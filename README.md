# üöÄ Binance Sell on Listing Bot

This Python script automatically places a limit sell order immediately after a new token is listed on Binance, at a configurable price below the market. It's built for speed, precision, and safety during high-volatility listing events.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Features

- **Async/await**: Built using asynchronous programming for maximum responsiveness with the Binance API.
- **Time synchronization**: Syncs local time with Binance server time to avoid clock drift.
- **Automatic start**: Begins checking for the trading pair 10 seconds before your specified launch time.
- **Continuous monitoring**: Polls the Binance REST API for the appearance of the trading pair.
- **Smart price and quantity calculation**: Applies Binance's `PRICE_FILTER` and `LOT_SIZE` to ensure your order meets exchange requirements.
- **Robust retry mechanism**: Retries fetching the current price to handle temporary network issues.
- **Automatic cancellation**: If the order isn't filled within a timeout (default: 30 seconds), it is cancelled.
- **Graceful shutdown**: Handles Ctrl-C (KeyboardInterrupt) and closes all Binance connections properly.
- **Tabular order output**: Uses [tabulate](https://pypi.org/project/tabulate/) for clear, structured order logs.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

1. **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Create a `config.py` file in the root directory:**
    ```python
    # config.py

    api_key = 'your_binance_api_key'
    api_secret = 'your_binance_api_secret'

    # Trading configuration
    pair = "ALTUSDT"                    # Example: 'SOMETOKENUSDT'
    coins_for_sale = "100"              # Amount of tokens to sell
    price_offset_percent = "1.0"        # Percent below market price (e.g., 1.0 means 1% below)

    # Timing
    order_timeout_seconds = 30          # Cancel order after this many seconds if not filled
    pair_check_interval_seconds = 0.5   # Interval (in sec) between trade pair availability checks
    launch_time_str = "2025-05-29 12:00:00" # Exact time trading is expected to start (UTC)
    ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: API Key Permissions

Make sure your Binance API key has **"Enable Spot & Margin Trading"** permission enabled.  
If you encounter an "Invalid API-key, IP, or permissions for action" error, check your API key, secret, and any IP restrictions on your Binance account.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Simply run:

```sh
python main.py

## üõ† Notes

- The time format for `launch_time_str` must be `"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"` in UTC.
- If you launch the bot after the listing time has passed, it will immediately begin checking for the pair.
- The script uses modern Python asyncio practices.
- Order details are displayed in a readable table format.
